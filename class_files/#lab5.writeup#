Head-modifier rules:
    In Georgian, all adjectives MUST precede (i.e. appear to the left) of the noun that they modify.  Therefore, I only require a adj-head-int-phrase, and not a head-adj-int-phrase.
	
	However, since I already had the rule:
	adj-head-int := adj-head-scop-phrase.
	in my grammar's rule.tdl, I had to modify it to :
	adj-head-scop := adj-head-scop-phrase
	so that I could add the rule:
	adj-head-int := adj-head-int-phrase.

	and then add to my lexicon.tdl:

	;; Adjectives
	ქართულ := adjective-lex &
	  [ STEM < "ქართულ" >,
	      SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_georgian_a_rel" ].

	At this point, if I enter in a sentence like 
	`ქართულ მასწავლებელ-ი წერილ-ს 0-0-წერ-PSF-ს'
	`georgian teacher-NOM letter-DAT NOPRE-3.OBJ-write-PSF-3.SG.SUBJ.PRES/FUT'
	which is grammatically incorrect, because the adjective hasn't had a case marker put on, I get a parse that puts the adjective modifying the correct noun.
	
	I will comment at this point, that using emacs to enter in sentences manually (with C-p), it will not parse.  But if I enter it in through the 'enter parse' dialogue in the LKB, it works fine.

Adverbs:
	When working with adverbs, I realized that I do need the head-adj-int rule as well, because adverbs can go more or less anywhere in the sentence.

	Therefore I have changed:
	head-adj-int := head-adj-scop-phrase.
	to:
	head-adj-scop := head-adj-scop-phrase.

	and added:
	head-adj-int := head-adj-int-phrase.

	My adverb-lex rule:
	
adverb-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ] >,
						   VAL [ SPR < >,
								 SUBJ < >,
								 COMPS < >,
								 SPEC < > ]]]]].

    Because my adjective rule above limits to POSTHEAD, and my adverb-lex doesn't, it allows for types of parses I had hoped for.
