;;;
;;; a first attempt at mapping (systematically) between the grammar-internal
;;; name space (where, for example, there may be reasons to group sets of index
;;; properties in nested feature structures) and the external, SEM-I compliant
;;; interface.
;;;

;;;
;;; from here on, sets of rules that map one or more properties into one or
;;; more properties: for each correspondence, values are compared to sub-rules
;;; in order, until the first match: at that point, output values are inserted
;;; into the result set of properties.  processing of rules continues against
;;; the original properties, so that there could be multiple matches: the `PN'
;;; to `PERS' and `NUM' decomposition, thus, could also be done in two separate
;;; rule sets.  at the end of the day, however, only properties resulting from
;;; successful matches will be in the output, i.e. everything not explicitly
;;; carried over will be deleted.
